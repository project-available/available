## Welcome to project available

Student have to contact librarian in order to use it. It sounds stupid and unnecessary to me so I created this app and handle it ourself.

Why stupid you may ask? This is the normal flow
1. Student come to the room that they want to book -> See if anyone in there -> Find the librarian contact left the door
2. Student send request to the librarian through some fishy message app
3. The librarian send back the format form the student have to fill out
4. The student then send the request in the correct format include the time span they wanna use the room
5. The librarian check the f*cking excel spreadsheet that he uses to keep track of the room status
6. If full then they have to choose another time 

The overhead between 2 people chatting is unnecessary.
