Our fellow students must contact the librarian via email, phone call, or message every time they wish to book a self-study room for their group of friends. As someone who uses this service frequently, I find it beneficial to create an automatic system that helps reduce repetitive tasks for the librarian when receiving booking requests and avoids overlapping with others.
